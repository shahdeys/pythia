# pythia

## What is it?

pythia is a Spotify bot written using Java 1.8 and Apollo.

## How is it made?

`todo: add high level design and goals here`

## What does it do?

The goal is to just return the current playing song. 

## Future plans?

I'd like it to be able to connect to other applications to have it interact with my bot whenever I decide to trigger it.
